<h2 align="center">👋 Hey, I'm Lu — I build products people actually love to use</h2>

<p align="center">
Shipping cross-platform apps (Flutter, React/Web etc) with a strong product mindset and a soft spot for AI.
I love turning real problems into useful, beautiful tools. 
I care about fast feedback loops, real user value, and shipping.
</p>

### 🧭 Focus right now
- **building products for startups & smbs** — fast MVPs → iterated v1s with clear metrics
- **cross-platform UX** — flutter for mobile, react/next.js for web; pragmatic stacks, clean APIs
- **AI that earns trust** — RAG, citations, eval harnesses, guardrails

---

### 🧩 current role (california ISO)
I’m currently building internal software and data tools in the **energy / grid** space — think operator-friendly dashboards, data validation, and reporting workflows that support **grid reliability and clean-energy integration**. It’s a great playground for real-world constraints, scale, and safety.

> tl;dr: i like hard problems with real users. and yes, I’m still open to building cool stuff on the side.

### 🤝 collaborating / availability
- open to **freelance, collab, or small equity projects**
- happy to advise on **MVP scoping, product strategy, and tech choices**
- especially interested in: **AI assistants**, **ops tooling**, **health/med-device data**, **climate/energy** software
