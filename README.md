<h2 align="center">👋 Hey there, I’m Lu Tang – Software Engineer & App Alchemist</h2>

<p align="center">I build beautiful, purposeful apps with Flutter, Firebase, Python, and a little finance magic.</p>

---

### 💻 What I Do

- 🛠️ I help startups turn napkin-sketch ideas into real, working apps.
- 💼 I also happen to know my way around business setup, finance, and accounting (yes, I make spreadsheets *and* apps).
- 🔬 Constantly exploring new tech—especially AI, because who doesn’t like a bit of future in their stack?
- 🎥 Occasionally posting raw, unfiltered dev life and Flutter tips on social media.

---

### 🌟 Why Work With Me?

- 🧠 I'm a cross-disciplinary dev—mixing software, finance, data science, and a bias toward building useful things.
- 🔄 I adapt fast and think like a founder. I write code that solves problems, not just fills sprints.
- 🧩 I love tackling complex systems and simplifying them with clean design and clear thinking.

### 🔍 Open to Collaborations

Let’s build something meaningful—whether it’s an AI-powered app, a community-driven platform, or just a weekend side project with coffee-fueled commits. Open to freelance, full-time, or fun-time work.

### 🤹 A Bit About Me

- 🌍 I wander through neighborhoods, trails, and countries—on foot, always curious.
- 📖 I enjoy reading offline (yes, that still exists!) in cozy corners of libraries and cafes.
- 🍜 I cook like I code—lots of flavor, a bit of improvisation, and usually spicy enough to keep it interesting.
